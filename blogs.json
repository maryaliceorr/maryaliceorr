        "post": "<p>Wow. What a couple of weeks this has already been. I ask people in passing if I look like a deshelved empty shell of a person. Usually, they look at me funny and confused. I then figure, I must look better than I feel.</p><p>Anywho, I guess what I am really supposed to be doing is writing about what I have learned. I have already learned a lot. Let me break it down by topic.</p><p><strong>HTML: </strong>I did not know how to create an abbreviated text tag.  I also figured out how to wrap those in anchor tags. Lastly, I now have an understanding of how to categorize my tags and how to use clean markup to use in tandem with CSS.</p><p><strong>CSS: </strong>I will start by saying, I really dislike this stuff. I do not mind the colors and fonts and sizing aspects, but when it comes to columns, I would love to be using boostrap instead of this stuff. I also really hate specificity, because I feel like CSS can be a little wonky when it wants to be, even when you feel like you are doing all the right things. That being said, I feel like the more I work with it the better I am getting.  I am just ready for the day when CSS does not feel like the perpetual thorn in my side that it currently is.</p><p><strong>GIT: </strong>This stuff is scary. I really did not understand this stuff after treehouse, but I feel like I have a much better understanding of this now. I understand how to use my terminal and command line.  I know how to make a repository, make a branch, figure out what branch I am on and how to commit that to github.  While, it still confuses me and I do things wrong sometimes, I feel accomplished for learning those things.</p><p><strong>github: </strong>Ok, this still confuses me. I am starting to 'get' it, but pull requests and merging still make me feel very nervous.  Right now, I feel like I am going through motions.  I think I will understand it better in the coming weeks and I am looking forward to that.</p>"

        "post": "<p>This week started out feeling a little bit better.  I felt like I was starting to absorb GIT and github and I was also ready to move onto JS. I learned quickly that I would soon regret that thought process. I felt good on the lesson on arrays until we got to the group homework.</p><p>I have two words for you. RED CARD.</p><p><strong>GIT and github: </strong> I feel like I understand branches, PRs and merging a lot better. Some of the command line still trips me up at times, but I feel like I at least understand the basics of this stuff and don't feel lost anymore.  What I liked learning the most about this section was how to commit and push branches as well as to use hs to open windows.</p><p><strong>JS: </strong>Oh JS, how I love and hate thee. I was actually looking forward to JS becuase I didn't struggle with it during the prework and I am mathematically minded, so I felt like I would understand JS pretty well. What I didn't understand is that JS has a very specific way of doing things which doesn't always match up with what you are thinking.</p><p>I learned some very valuable lessons.  I realized that in order to print to the DOM via JS, you have to put document. before getElementById or it won't work.  I spent a few hours trying to figure out why I couldn't see an answer to challenge only to find out I forgot the the document. piece.</p><p>My other big valuable lesson this week was remembering to put the script tags in my html near the bottom of the body tags. I could have salvaged so much happiness had I remembered to do that.</p><p>Overall, I feel as though this class is one long version of 'Karate Kid' and that at some point I will understand all of what I'm doing and it will all come down to one big 'I got Miyagied moment'. That's my hope anyway.</p>"

        "post": "<p>So...this week I felt better going into it because I worked on the JS objects homework and got through it for the most part. I got stuck on the first excercise for a bit, but I worked through it and then the other excercises seemed to come a lot faster and easier. However, when we went over some of the functions material and advanced function methods, I felt about as lost as Nemo. Things got a little bit better when we went over project planning, as I do that in my job in a different capacity almost everyday.  I am ready for JS advanced methods to make more sense.</p><p><strong>JS: </strong>I get confused in the following areas: advanced array methods, function placeholders, and variable names within functions. I think a next step I'm going to try and take is to read over some of the extra JS material as well breakdown functions like algebraic equations.  I get very confused by the variable and placeholder names, epsecially if they are similar to other variable or function names.</p><p>What I would like to do is replace variable names and placeholders with algebra variables like a, b and c or x, y and z.  I would then like to see if I better absorb how functions work.</p><p><strong>Project Planning:</strong>This part was enjoyable and a nice break from the madness. What I learned from this session is that planning is key. I enjoyed walking through the steps of planning from the bare bones of what the project needs as an MVP, to wireframes, to ticketing. I think this process will really help our group work be more efficient and cohesive.</p>"

        "post": "<p>This week felt better overall. After our group project and working on the advanced array method for the project, I feel better about JS functions and JS in general. I still need more practice to get really comfortable, but I at least don't feel lost anymore.</p><p><strong>ES6: </strong>Using const and let took a little bit of time to grasp, but I feel like the more I use them the easier it will be to use them and know when to. I sort of try to think about when to use them like I do when I'm choosing an id or a class in CSS as far as uniqueness goes.</p><p><strong>DOM Interaction: </strong>Going over event listeners helped me quite a bit to understand why I could not get text to print to the DOM in the language translator challenge. The function I was trying to use in the language translator was being called before the page loaded which meant any input a user typed in would not print. That was a hugely valuable lesson to me. Also traversing the DOM using parent.node made a lot of sense to me.  It reminds me a lot of cd in the terminal.  I think having a better understanding of git helped a lot for that lesson.</p><p><strong>Markdown: </srong>Markdown seems easy enough.  It's another CSS type thing where we are supposed to be good at looking up how to do it instead of learning it directly. Again, I think the more we use it, the easier it will be to write README files.</p>"

        "post": "<p><strong>JSON: </strong>This stuff seems easy enough. The main takeaways for me were that you have to put everything (inlcuding keys) in double quotes and that you can't put comments in JSON. Otherwise, this seems pretty straight forward.</p><p><strong>XHR: </strong>I'm not sure how I feel about this yet. It seems to makes sense, but I am not sure I will fully understand it until we get to the back end. I didn't feel lost this week, but I'm not sure if that's because I have accepted the fact that I will not understand everything fully immediately, but I know as we go I will catch on to all of this. Anyway, I like learning these types of things because I understand how important being able to pull data in from somewhere else is for future use. I think I will appreciate XHR much more in time. Also, the part that interested me most was th sync vs. async piece.  I think this will actually help me understand some things from my current job due to the way script tags in ad ops run async or sync and how that affects ad calls. I'm interested to see how this works with the back end in the future.</p>"
