          <p>Who am I? My name is Mary Alice Orr and now I am a coder. I suppose you could classify me as a "Jane of all trades" because I enjoy lots of things. What kinds of things you might ask? Well, when I'm working I enjoy creating, building, and analyzing anything and everything. In my free time I enjoy paddleboarding with my husky, rock climbing in the great outdoors, photographing national parks, playing bluesy guitar, or cooking a gourmet meal. So...how did I get to where I am now?</p>

          <p>As a little girl, I was fascinated by how things worked. I wanted to know why they worked and what made them tick. Whether it was testing cookie recipes in my Easy-Bake Oven, conducting science experiments with household items, or building toy robots, I wanted to understand how ideas became final products. My parents always thought I would be an engineer and while that’s not technically what I do for a living, it is exactly how I approach my work. </p>

          <p>That tinkering mindsight led me to Nashville Software School, where I'm currently studying web development. At work, I specialize in advertising operations and revenue optimization. My true talent, however, lies in understanding the big picture. When I’m working on a project, I think of it as a giant chess game. Every piece on the board represents a responsibility I have learned: web development, marketing, branding, advertising, sales, data analytics, and revenue returns. Every piece has to work in tandem and every roadblock must be anticipated and negated for the game to be won. If one piece gets taken before its job is done, the whole game is compromised. </p>

          <p>Every day, I'm learning something new in today's digital landscape. Coding has taught me to look at websites in a completely different light and also created a forum for me to learn. I'm excited </p>
