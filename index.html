            <h2>Blog Week #1</h2>
            <article> 
                <p>Wow. What a couple of weeks this has already been. I ask people in passing if I look like a deshelved empty shell of a person. Usually, they look at me funny and say, "ugh no??" and look confused. I then reply with an "ok good, I guess I look better than I feel."</p>
                <p>Anywho, I guess what I'm really supposed to be doing is writing about what I have learned. I have already learned a lot. Let me break it down by topic.</p>
                <p><strong>HTML:</strong> I didn't know how to create an abbreviated text tag.  I also figured out how to wrap those in anchor tags. Lastly, I now have an understanding of how to categorize my tags and how to use clean markup to use in tandem with CSS.</p>
                <p><strong>CSS:</strong> I'll start by saying, I really dislike this stuff. I don't mind the colors and fonts and sizing aspects, but when it comes to columns, I would love to be using boostrap instead of this stuff. I also really hate specificity, because I feel like CSS can be a little wonky when it wants to be, even when you feel like you're doing all the right things. That being said, I feel like the more I work with it the better I'm getting.  I'm just ready for the day when CSS doesn't feel like the perpetual thorn in my side that it currently is.</p>
                <p><strong>GIT:</strong> This stuff is scary. I really didn't understand this stuff after treehouse, but I feel like I have a much better understanding of this now. I understand how to use my terminal and command line.  I know how to make a repository, make a branch, figure out what branch I'm on and how to commit that to github.  While, it still confuses me and I do things wrong sometimes, I feel accomplished for learning those things.</p>
                <p><strong>github:</strong> Ok, this still confuses me. I'm starting to "get" it, but pull requests and merging still make me feel very nervous.  Right now, I feel like I'm going through motions.  I think I'll understand it better in the coming weeks and I'm looking forward to that.</p>

            <h2>Blog Week #2</h2>
            <article> 
                <p>Ths week started out feeling a little bit better.  I felt like I was starting to absorb GIT and github and I was also ready to move onto JS. I learned quickly that I would soon regret that thought process. I felt good on the lesson on arrays until we got to the group homework. </p>
                <p>I have two words for you. RED CARD.</p>
                <p><strong>GIT and github:</strong> I feel like I understand branches, PRs and merging a lot better. Some of the command line still trips me up at times, but I feel like I at least understand the basics of this stuff and don't feel lost anymore.  What I liked learning the most about this section was how to commit and push branches as well as to use hs to open windows.</p>
                <p><strong>JS:</strong> Oh JS, how I love and hate thee. I was actually looking forward to JS becuase I didn't struggle with it during the prework and I am mathematically minded, so I felt like I would understand JS pretty well. What I didn't understand is that JS has a very specific way of doing things which doesn't always match up with what you are thinking.</p>
                <p>I learned some very valuable lessons.  I realized that in order to print to the DOM via JS, you have to put document. before getElementById or it won't work.  I spent a few hours trying to figure out why I couldn't see an answer to challenge only to find out I forgot the the document. piece.</p>
                <p>My other big valuable lesson this week was remembering to put the script tags in my html near the bottom of the body tags. I could have salvaged so much happiness had I remembered to do that.</p> 
                <p>Overall, I feel as though this class is one long version of "Karate Kid" and that at some point I will understand all of what I'm doing and it will all come down to one big "I got Miyagied moment". That's my hope anyway.</p>
