                <h2>Personal Bio</h2>
                <article>
                    <p>As a little girl, I was fascinated by how things worked. I wanted to know why they worked and what made them tick. I wanted to create, experiment, utilize, analyze, fix and improve anything and everything. Whether it was testing cookie recipes in my Easy-Bake Oven, conducting science experiments with household items, or building toy robots, I wanted to understand how ideas became final products. My parents always thought I would be an engineer and while that’s not technically what I do for a living, it is exactly how I approach my work. 
                    </p>
                    <p>Currently, I specialize in advertising operations, but my true talent lies in understanding the big picture. I believe in testing, letting data speak for itself and turning my findings into action to solve a problem or achieve a goal. When I’m working on a project, I think of it as a giant chess game. Every piece on the board represents a responsibility I have learned: prospecting, client building, strategic partnerships, campaign optimization, data analytics, inventory management, reporting, forecasting, billing, and revenue returns. Every piece has to work in tandem and every roadblock must be anticipated and negated for the game to be won. If one piece gets taken before its job is done, the whole game is compromised. </p>
                    <p>Bottom line, I will always seek to grow, to critically think about my work, to evolve, to overachieve and I will never, ever give up. I know because that little girl I described before is still trying to understand what makes everything tick, just on a larger scale.</p>
